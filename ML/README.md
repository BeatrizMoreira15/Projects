## Development of Deep Learning Classifiers: Urban Sound Data  

This repository contains an academic project developed as part of the study on deep learning applications in audio classification.  

### **Project: Urban Sound Classification using Deep Learning**  
Development of deep learning classifiers for classifying sound excerpts using the UrbanSound8k dataset.  

- Implementation of data processing, exploratory data analysis, and feature extraction techniques (MFCCs).  
- Training and evaluation of deep learning models for sound classification.  
- Comparison of different architectures, including CNNs and RNNs.
