## Development of Deep Learning Classifiers: Urban Sound Data  

This repository contains an academic project developed as part of the study on deep learning applications in audio classification.  

### **Project: Urban Sound Classification using Deep Learning**  
Development of deep learning classifiers for classifying sound excerpts using the UrbanSound8k dataset.  

- Data preprocessing and feature extraction. 
- Implementation of deep learning models, including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).  
- Training, evaluation, and performance comparison of MLP and CNN architectures for sound classification.
